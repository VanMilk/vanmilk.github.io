Post credits: What to do after you make a game

Simply put, anything your heart desires! If you've successfully went through the process and fully developed a game you've already acquired lots of basic skills you can always expand upon in a specialized field.

What sort of field could i work in?

Well that all depends on what you've learned so far with making your game, of course the basics are always a great thing to have on your resume. Basic understanding of a programming language, character design and modeling, storyboarding/storytelling, music, sound design. This also goes for the programs you've learned how to use thus far as well!

Having basic knowledge of programming could lead you into a number of computer based internships.
Character modeling and animation could lead you into most art related fields.
Music and sound design is a big important piece of movies and tv along with everywhere else dealing with audio based technology.
Knowing how to use popular/commonly used software is also a great way to show of your skills and can be applied with ease.


What about things outside of game design?

There are definitely skills outside of this regard that can be deemed invaluable and could be a must for some companies depending on positions. Team management being one of them, if you build your own development team you'll need to be open and vocal on who's doing what, progression of the project, resource management, and networking between other companies or people.

In the end:

This is most definitely the tip of the iceberg on what you can do with everything you learn, either for personal use or professionally, on such a journey you'll need to market yourself and your skills.
