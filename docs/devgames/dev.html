						<h2 class="s1w">Let's start from the beginning.
							<br> There isn't a skill you need to start
							<br> learning and now is the perfect time to learn.
							<br> With ample resources and the internet
							<br> learning a new skill is just a few clicks away.
							<br> All that you need is time dedication.
							<br> None of the games you love or the products
							<br> you use in your everyday was made through
							<br> talent. All you need to do is to pour hours
							<br> into getting better and improving your skills.<br><br><br>

						<h2 class="s2w">Detail doesn't have to be everything.
							<br> You don't need to be an amazing artist.
							<br> Games come in all kinds of looks and
							<br> styles and there's no minimum requirement
							<br> you'd need to meet to make a great game.
							<br> Even with the simplest of looks you can
							<br> make a masterpiece. A great example of this
							<br> is a game called <a class="dlinks" href="https://managore.itch.io/outline" target="blank">Outline</a><br><br><br>

						<h2 class="s3w">You don't have to be an amazing musician.
							<br> Musical talent isn't everything either, you
							<br> don't need a dedicated band to make music
							<br> for you, deep knowledge on music editing
							<br> software, or any number of expensive
							<br> equipment just to try and make your audio
							<br> sound better. The only thing you need is to
							<br> be able to record, after that you're all set.
							<br> A great way to prove this is the game <a class="dlinks" href="https://parrudo-productions.itch.io/pencil-peril" target="blank">Pencil Peril</a> <br><br><br>

						<h2 class="s4w">You don't need to be an amazing programmer
							<br> either. Do you know of the game Undertale?
							<br><br> The creator of this game, TobyFox, was still
							<br> relatively new to programming at the time
							<br> and it's quite evident in portions of his code.
							<br> Despite this he made Undertale which sold over
							<br> 500k by the end of 2015 copies and that number
							<br> has only soared over time.
