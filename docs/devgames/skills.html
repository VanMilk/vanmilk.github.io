Front-end developers help ensure that end users have a seamless experience and can easily navigate to the website or web application's various features.<br><br><br><br>If you’re still interested in developing, then another field you could go into is Software development. Software developers design and create programs and applications for a variety of computer systems which also includes apps on your mobile phone. A great example of this is the browser you’re currently using to view this website. Different programs require unique programming languages, so many professionals in this career specialize in a certain coding language.<br><br><br><br>What if you like computers and other technology and understand it, but you aren’t a fan of coding or development? Then you’ll be a fan of this last field, Technical writing. A Technical writer's job is to communicate complex and technical information in the form of instruction manuals, how-to guides, journal articles, ect. Without these people we’d have to learn, break down, and pick apart things ourselves to understand how to create or utilize them.</h1>
